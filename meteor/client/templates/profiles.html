        <a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">ATV</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The all-terrain vehicle (ATV) or Quad subject drives an ATV either for recreation or some other activity (hunting, work, etc.). If the subject got lost while driving the ATV, the incident was classified as ATV. If the subject got lost while doing some other primary activity, e.g., hunting, then he was classified as Hunter. In reality, search planners will not know which scenario is applicable (unless it is recreational use). Therefore, search planners will need to find the appropriate blend of ATV and other activity.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The most common scenario is trauma (48%), which may also disable the ATV. For most other subject profiles trauma rarely plays a significant role. Common features for where accidents occur include water crossings. Searchers must pay particular attention to points where the ATV could easily leave the trail if control is lost. Looking for sign should be second nature. If initial hasty searches fail to locate the ATV on a trail, extra emphasis should be placed on signcutting or searching potential locations where an ATV might leave the trail or “run off.” Lost is the second most common scenario (24%) and is due to subject taking the wrong trail/road at a decision point, poor or no trail markings, no map or subject becoming disoriented. Separation of groups is common. After experiencing a mechanical problem or accident some subjects became lost attempting to return on foot. Many subjects (24%) were overdue or stranded because of poor trails, night, obstacles or mechanical breakdowns. Running out of gas tends to be rare, but when it occurs it is more common on the return leg of an out-and-back or circuit trip. Investigation can help determine if the subject is likely to stay on trails/roads or go cross-country.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Abandoned Vehicle</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">After an accident, running out of gas, or becoming stranded (snow, wedged on a rock, etc.), some occupants of the vehicle may decide to abandon the vehicle. The goal of leaving the vehicle may be either to get rescued or to evade law enforcement because of a possible driving (or other) violation. If they are evading, they typically return to a residence and claim not to have been driving. Criminal and evading scenarios account for almost a quarter (21%) of the incidents. Investigative finds account for another quarter (26%). Simply becoming lost while on foot accounts for almost half of the incidents (42%). A subject suffering from a medical or trauma-related problem accounts for only 10% of the incidents. Subjects leaving a vehicle may or may not be prepared for weather conditions depending upon what is typically kept in the vehicle. Fuel status or how the engine heater can be used may be a determining factor. Subject most likely will not have a detailed map of the area. Most subjects attempt to follow roads, but some will also follow linear features or end up in water features.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Abduction</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Data for abductions is mostly drawn from stranger abduction of children data sources. The Brown, et al. report focuses only on homicides; however, it is important to note that not all abductions end in homicide. The ISRID database (although much more limited in number) does include cases in which the subject is found alive. While the vast majority of abductions are family abductions, these incidents will not usually result in a formal search effort. Other types of abductions exist, but it is not clear how often they result in searches. It is assumed that data for abducted adults may be somewhat similar, although attempts to hide the body are less common with murdered adults (14%) than children (55.4%), and it is more difficult to move an adult body. In abduction cases, the behavior of the missing subject becomes somewhat irrelevant and the behavior of the perpetrator drives the incident. More than half of the cases (60%) for abducted children start as simple lost person cases. Yet, search planners should avoid total emphasis on the Abduction scenario (i.e., conduct a search effort along with an abduction investigation) since only one in 10,000 missing children reports is an abduction. ISRID search data contains statistics for abducted children with more ominous results: 4% of searches in the urban environment and 0.3% in the wilderness/rural setting are abductions.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Not all abductions end in fatalities—16% are found alive using the limited ISRID data. In 2006, of cases in which AMBER Alerts were issued, 94% are found alive and 3% are no trace.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">In abduction cases, it is important for search teams to be aware of several locations that may offer critical clues and evidence: point last seen (PLS), initial contact site (with perpetrator), murder site, and body recovery site. In some cases a separate assault site may exist. Field resources must be aware of and attempt to locate each site. When the subject is murdered, an attempt to conceal the body occurs in 55% of cases. The perpetrator typically uses material on hand (vegetation, debris, rocks, ground cover, and trash). Searchers must pay attention to the ground for any possible ground disturbance, including tracks. They should also move away brush or old rugs. In addition, in 69% of the cases, the murder site is within 200 feet of the body. Discarded evidence is often found along roads within one mile of the body location (56%).</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">In 64% of cases, the distance from the point last seen to the initial contact site is less than 200 feet (80% under 0.25 miles). In 36% of the cases, the point last seen is within 0.25 miles of the perpetrator’s residence. The Brown report does not give a classic maximum zone; it reports only subjects found greater than 12 miles from the PLS. Using the limited number of cases found in the ISRID database it is possible to report a maximum zone. However, the specific number is being withheld. Search managers should contact the FBI, National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), a Team Adam consultant (in the US) or a national clearinghouse in their respective countries for the information. It is worth noting that the distance may be beyond local jurisdictional boundaries and multi-jurisdictional coordination is critical.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Searchers and search planners should be aware of perpetrators’ tendency when “dumping” the subject to find a location that is quick and easy, typically involves a vehicle, but is also secluded. Typical locations often are turn-outs, culverts, and sides of bridges. Remote roads with little traffic have a high probability. The subject is typically found not far from the road. Dumps and dump sites also have higher probability.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">A “typical” case is an 11-year-old Caucasian female from a middle class or blue collar family with good family relations. Classic indicators of sexually motivated abductions include white female, aged five to twelve, missing from home or familiar place with no history of running away; she is described as happy, and the disappearance is unexplained. The more red flags raised, the more immediate and aggressive the response.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Age 1-3</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">If lost as part of a group with adults, a child is classified as adult group. If with a group of children, the subjects are classified based upon the oldest child. Single subjects are placed in Toddler category based upon age regardless of activity unless external forces such as entering the water or abduction (i.e., there are not too many solo-hiking two-year-olds.)</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Concept of being “lost” does not develop until age three. Toddlers at three are able to walk rhythmically, change to a run, jump, hop and climb. Toddlers lack any true navigational skills; sense of direction is almost non-existent. Older toddlers may have an allowable home range (outdoor territory for independent travel, play and exploration). Many children fail to follow limits parents place on the home range. Range of “lost” distances can be 60% greater than home range distances. Aimless wandering is the general rule. If a target location is being sought it would be for a location previously visited with parents or others. Most go missing from home. They may be attracted to animals and water. They tend not to respond to whistles or calls. Prior training may alter this, but preventative programs at this age are uncommon. They rarely walk out by themselves. They are difficult to detect because of their small size and ability to squeeze into small spaces. They are often hiding or sleeping in a structure, including yards and outbuildings. They will penetrate brush to sleep or hide. Many toddlers are found asleep inside a structure or in the brush. A sleeping child may not even respond to his own parents shouting his name. Toddlers are capable of sleeping through loud noises (Many parents often train children to sleep with loud noises.). Good survivability is due to a child’s tendency to find shelter and a typically urgent aggressive search response.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Distances traveled are generally rather limited. However, important differences exist among temperate, dry and urban domains/areas. Statistical data tables presented may be specific to age group (1-3), a subset of all children (1-6) or for all children (1-12) depending upon the amount of information.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Age 10-12</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">If lost as part of a group with adults, a child is classified based upon adult activity. If with a group of children, then the subjects are classified based upon the oldest child. Single subjects are placed in Pre-Teenager category regardless of activity unless wheels or water involved.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Spatial concepts are improving at this age: pre-teens are able to give clear, well-organized directions, draw and read maps. They have a mental map of the local area, but this is often distorted or wrong. There is a dramatic increase in the number of lost 11- and 12-year-olds. Home range continues to expand. Many children fail to follow limits parents place on the home range. Range of “lost” distances can be 93% greater than home range distances. By age 10-11 they will start to make special note of decision points on a new route. Mistakes at decision points are more likely to occur in the middle of a route versus at the beginning or end. Twelve-year-olds travel approximately 14% farther than the shortest possible route in attempted shortcuts. By age 12, a child’s skill of scanning for familiar landmarks, paths or scenes is as developed as an adult’s.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Children in this age category frequently become lost because of taking shortcuts (which may represent a longer route). They are commonly involved in fantasy play, exploring or adventuring. When lost they use a trail/road following a strategy. This accounts for those who travel considerable distances. Children older than six may initially move randomly when lost but then later adopt one of five strategies: trail running, direction sampling, view enhancing, contouring and staying put. Those who decide to stay put may choose a familiar location or areas that offer a view. More than half are found in structures, vehicles or yards. They may be hiding intentionally to avoid punishment, to gain attention or they are sulking. They are drawn to wilderness areas. This age group has many of the same fears and concerns as adults but with greater emotion. A high percent are investigative finds, especially in urban environments. Girls are more likely to be at a friend’s house, boys are more likely to be outside, and both will use public transportation. They may travel great distances to visit previous friends.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Age 13-15</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The Youth category is based solely upon age. If lost as part of a group with adults, the subject was classified based upon adult activity: If with a group of children, the subject was classified based upon oldest child. In many cases the subject was also engaged in an outdoor activity that also exists as a separate subject category. In other cases, the youth is simply involved in some type of general play. Search planners should consult both sets of statistics and profiles when the subject was involved in an activity. For youths involved in hiking, the distances from the IPP were identical to Hiker. Other activities did not have sufficient data to make comparisons.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">By age 12 a child’s skill of scanning for familiar landmarks, paths or scenes are as developed as an adult’s. Young adolescents have developed deductive reasoning and abstract thoughts; hence, their potential navigational skills may be as good as an adult’s. What they often lack is experience and maturity.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Youths involved in activities are different from adults in several respects. When involved in an activity, a play or fantasy component is often present. They are also more likely to be part of a group (41%) and have good survivability. If part of a group, once lost they tend to stay together. Important sex differences exist. Boys tend to be in the woods and are more likely to be classified as lost or overdue. Girls may be in the woods, but are more likely to be in a structure and classified as an investigative search. When in the woods, girls may be evading or classified as a runaway. History of an emotional encounter (parent/boyfriend) is common for missing females. Deaths (for both sexes) are due to suicide, abductions and water. Drowning is the second leading accidental cause of death for those under 15 years of age. Poor swimmers are more likely to enter water due to peer pressure; and bold divers may dive into swallow water. A large majority (70%) are lost and only 18% are overdue. Children older than six may initially move randomly when lost, but then later adopt one of four strategies (trail running, direction sampling, view enhancing and staying put). Look at the relevant activity profile to see typical causes of becoming lost or overdue. Evading and investigation account for 10% of cases.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Age 4-6</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">If lost as part of a group with adults, a child is classified based upon adult activity. If with a group of children, subjects are classified based upon the oldest child. Single subjects are in the Preschool category regardless of activity unless external force or on wheels.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Children age four to six are more mobile and capable than those in the one- to three-year old category. They run smoothly, gallop and are able to skip with one foot. They understand being lost and attempt to return home, to a familiar place or to the caregiver. The mind is a mixture of reason, fantasy, and faulty logic. At six years old, a child can be taught to turn around and to note and remember landmarks. At six years old, a child is focused on end points, although often neglects or is unable to describe all the decision points along the way. Preschoolers have an allowable home range (outdoor territory for independent travel, play and exploration). Range of “lost” distances can be 50% greater than home range distances. Many children fail to follow limits parents place on the home range. Five- to seven-year-old children accompany peers or older playmates to sites beyond view of the house. They have definite interests and may attempt to travel to specific locations. They may be easily drawn by animals (this includes following pets), water, finding a playmate, exploring, following children or imaginative play. They may not understand the concept of a return trip when engaged in imaginative play. They often follow tracks, trails, and shortcuts that do not easily appear or make sense to adults. When lost they seek familiarity, looking for landmarks, a path or scene that they have experienced.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Children this age are difficult to detect because of their small size and ability to squeeze into small spaces. In urban settings, hiding in a structure or yard still accounts for over half of the finds. They are often hiding or sleeping in a structure, including yards and outbuildings. They may hide in trunks, boxes or appliances and be unable to escape. Often they have been instructed to avoid strangers. They may hide or not respond to searchers. However, when hungry they tend to become more responsive.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Age 7-9</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">If lost as part of a group with adults, a child is classified based upon adult activity. If with a group of children, the subjects are classified based upon the oldest child. Single subjects are placed in School Age category based upon age regardless of activity unless wheels or water.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Visual-spatial (directional) skills are much more developed in this age category than those under six. Spatial concepts are improving at this age; they are able to give clear, well-organized directions, draw and read maps. They have a mental map of the local area but this is often distorted or wrong. It is common to become lost in a new setting. They are expanding the home range (outdoor territory for independent travel, play and exploration). Many children fail to follow limits parents place on the home range. Range of “lost” distances can be 400% greater than home range distances. By age seven, children have accompanied peers or older playmates to sites beyond view of the house. When first learning a route eight-year-olds remember the places at the beginning and the end. Eight-year-olds also travel approximately 50% further than the shortest possible route in attempted shortcuts. Some nine-year-olds will start to make special note of decision points. Mistakes at decision points are most likely to occur in the middle of the route versus at the beginning or the end.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Children in this age category frequently become lost because they attempt to take shortcuts (which may represent a longer route).

Girls are more likely to be at a friend’s house; boys are more likely to be outside.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Aircraft</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Aircraft incidents are initiated by witness reports of seeing or hearing a crash, fire or smoke, and by distress beacons, distress calls, overdue flight plans, a missing person report, failure to contact flight center, and radar information. Crashes may occur due to mechanical problems, fuel management, weather, pilot medical problems, and pilot error. Crashes tend to occur near the tops of ridges (in mountainous terrain), during take-off and landing, and at the intersection of aircraft and severe weather.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The results presented here come from different sources. The track offset results come from the Canadian New Two Area Method (NTAM) and research by John Desmarais. NTAM used data from Canada; the Desmarais results were based upon data from the continental US (CONUS). Desmarais advocates that area two should be based upon a 20nm offset box versus the NTAM 15 nm box (either side). Distance from entry into a weather front comes from Syrotuck and McIver. Distance from the last National Track Analysis Program (NTAP) radar plot was obtained from ISRID data. Survivability results were obtained from ISRID, US Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC), and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) sources.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The NTAP data were taken from search incidents recorded by the AFRCC from 2002 to 2005. Aircraft incidents that resulted in a search, obtained NTAP data, and resulted in a find were entered into the ISRID database. Coordinates of the last NTAP plot (radar information obtained from the US Federal Aviation Administration, RADES or other sources which serve as an IPP) and the aircraft’s final coordinates were used to determine the distance from the last plot. Two sets of statistics are given. The first is labeled the correlated set. In 75% of the cases, the last NTAP plot appears to relate to the find location using a 30-mile threshold (determined by the distance from the last NTAP to find location being no greater than 30 miles). The correlated results should be used by ground planners. However, planners need to realize that in 25% of the incidents the aircraft is often well outside of the maximum zone (95%). The last two NTAP coordinates were used to determine the last bearing. The difference between the last known bearing and the actual bearing (from the last NTAP to the find location) determined the dispersion angle.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Minimal information is available on missing helicopters and jets. However, it appears that jets are found close to the last plot. Helicopters, on the other hand, may be found considerable distances away from the last plot. This can be explained by a helicopter’s ability to fly under radar coverage.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">It is also important for searchers to know that satellites ceased being able to detect 121.5 ELT signals on February 1, 2009. Detection is now typically by a passing aircraft hearing a signal. Only 406 beacons are heard by the satellites.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Skier-Alpine</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Alpine (downhill) skiers were engaged in skiing for either recreation (almost all of the cases) or work. Alpine skiers are differentiated from Nordic (cross- country) skiers and snowboarders, who make up other subject categories. Almost all alpine skiers use lifts, but during the off-season or for other reasons some will hike up and then ski down. In some cases, extreme skiers may rent helicopters (heli-skiing) for truly remote locations. Guides are often included in most services. This category includes both in-bounds and out-of-bounds skiers.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Skiers are well-dressed for the current weather and often carry some equipment, including some food and water. Generally, they will not carry survival equipment, although 60% have some survival training. Most are in good physical shape and have some experience. Being lost accounts for the majority of incidents (53%). Almost half (46%) will self-rescue. When they are lost, it is usually because of taking wrong turns and missing trails. It is common for lost skiers to have skied out-of-bounds. Some may attempt to climb back up to the point where they went out-of-bounds. However, ski boots make walking difficult and slow at best.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Weather, white-out or blizzard conditions and darkness are major contributors to mistakes at decision points. Many skiers are found at a trailhead or on a trail, though it is also common to find them back at the lodge, a bar or home, so the Investigative scenario remains important. When skiers are overdue (13%) it is typically caused by misjudging time, snow conditions, weather conditions, equipment problems, and miscommunication. When lost or overdue skiers either keep moving to stay warm, build snow shelters or break into structures. Mitchell found 30-45% moved at night. Natural light (moon) or other light increases probability that the subject will move at night. Avalanches may be an important factor (18%). Skiers account for 24% of avalanche fatalities in the US. Backcountry skiers accounted for 16%, out-of-bounds skiers 8%, and skiing in-bounds (1%). Trauma (17%) is also an important consideration for alpine skiers. Even when skiing in-bounds, accidents requiring searches may occur when the skier leaves the groomed trail and goes off into trees.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Angler</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The subject category Angler includes all subjects engaged in fishing as the primary activity. In many cases the angler hiked to or from the actual fishing location. However, if fishing was the primary activity, incidents were classified as Angler. Anglers may be shore-based, boat-based or in the water. This causes differences in overall behavior. Cross-reference with Hiker and boating subject categories (Water-Related) if applicable.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Anglers become lost while en route or returning. This is the most common reason for becoming lost and is similar to lost hikers making mistakes at decision points. In some cases being wet or slightly hypothermic may contribute to poor decisions. While most anglers are able to use water to stay oriented, typical mistakes occur getting to the water or where the waterway becomes confusing (forks when traveling upstream, networks of lakes, etc.). Alcohol may play an important role, especially for those fishing from a boat. After the lost scenario (44%), the second most common scenario was overdue (30%). This was typically caused by darkness, miscommunication or deciding to stay longer. If using a boat, engine problems, fuel, and navigation (especially if it became dark) were important factors. In several cases, the subject became stranded (23%) by either rising water levels or tides. In addition, a significant number drowned (7%).</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Autism</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Any subject with any of the autism spectrum disorders was placed into this category regardless of age or activity. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) or pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) include autistic disorder (or classic autism), Rett’s disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (atypical autism), childhood disintegrative disorder, and Asperger’s syndrome. The two most common among the ISRID database were autism and Asperger’s syndrome. A vast spectrum of ability exists among the disorders, from awkward PhD to complete inability to communicate or function in society.

            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">In addition, the autistic triad is often mentioned: difficulty with communication, social relationships, and understanding others’ state of mind. Autism affects 3.7 times more males than females, and the incidence (in the United States) is estimated at 1 in 178 children (ages 4-17).</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">In most school settings the autistic student will have an Individualized Education Program (IEP). The IEP is typically developed at a meeting with the parents, teacher, school district administrator, and often other professionals. Reviewing the IEP or having a summary of the IEP will give the search planner a much better idea about the subject’s strengths, weaknesses, and skills that are currently being addressed. </p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">General behaviors associated with autism include the following:• Easily over stimulated, cannot filter out normal distractions.• Become easily upset in noisy environments, often resulting in withdrawing or attempting to escape.• Preference for being alone, will often leave group or group setting, difficulty interacting with others.• Possibility of being evasive.• Insistence on sameness and routines.• No real fears of danger.• May have under-sensitivity to pain.• Fascination with water, lights, and reflections.• Some may show intense interest in transportation (trains, trucks, airplanes, cars).• Non-responsive to verbal cues; acts as if deaf. Subject is expected to be unresponsive to searchers’ shouts.• Many with autism are prone to elopement; may be referred to as “runners.” Subject may be attempting to reach a specific target or in other cases simply trying to leave current situation with no destination in mind.• Good survivability largely due to rapid and urgent response.• Individually characteristic methods of reacting to stress.• Repetitive behaviors are common(e.g., spinning, handflapping, and other repetitive behaviors); frequency varies along vast spectrum of individual differences seen with autism.• Structures are the most common find location. Some have hidden in structures for extended periods of time.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Extreme Race</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Extreme Sports represents a relatively new outdoor activity. The more commercial definition involves skateboarding, in-line skating, mountain biking, snowboarding, skiing, etc. However, most of those activities are separate subject categories. The various activities placed into the Extreme Sports category include extreme race/event management, canyoneering (kloofing), rogaining (extreme orienteering), and dog racing. The majority of missing subjects were missed at various checkpoints (during a race) but in the end were most often overdue (57%). Fatigue, over-exertion and over-estimating one’s ability also account for overdue cases. Being lost accounts for 36% of the cases because of classic mistakes at decision points along trails or disorientation in more demanding cross-country navigation events. Because of check-in systems, the distances from the IPP are not usually great. In canyoneering, several hazards exist, travel may be difficult, and flash floods present a unique hazard to both participants and searchers. A canyon limits navigation demands (and escape routes in case of flooding) because there is usually only one way into or out of it; however, it is still possible to get turned around. Long-term survivability for extreme sports is surprisingly good (again, based upon limited results).</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Car Camper</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Campers are located at a campsite and may be engaged in a variety of activities around the campsite. Heth and Cornell first defined the category as “Persons whose vehicles and other gear were at campground maintained by park personnel.” The term “car camping” would also be appropriate. If planning a hike, they would be classified as Hiker. Backpackers, even if staying in a campground for the night, are also classified as Hiker. Children are placed into the age appropriate Child category. Subjects with dementia have become lost in campgrounds. However, they would be classified under Dementia.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">While most campers become lost in the immediate vicinity (59%), several other more “urban” scenarios are possible. Campgrounds often have a vast network of interconnecting marked and unmarked trails that often cause confusion. In addition, miscommunication, investigative causes, evading, and substance abuse all occur. Simply being overdue from the planned activity accounts for 25% of the incidents. Subjects are not typically prepared for the outdoors. Subjects may not have any substantial outdoor experience. Large differences in ability may also exist. Half of the subjects are lost in a group. If the campsite is near water, drowning is possible.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Caver</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Caver includes anyone involved in entering a cave, even if intoxicated or under the influence of a substance, as well as those who informed others they were setting out to enter a cave. This category does not include cave divers.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Most cave incidents reflect rescues rather than searches. ISRID collected 254 cave incidents; 34 incidents (13%) represented searches. However, using NSS data it appears that approximately 45% of cave incidents do involve a search aspect. Cave incident data are from ISRID and the National Speleological Society (NSS) and are cited accordingly. In ISRID among missing cavers, being lost accounts for 26% of incidents. Being overdue accounts for the majority of the incidents (53%); trauma (11%) and medical (5%) are significant. In some cases, cavers were overdue for reasons other than caving. Using NSS data (a much larger database, but it collects data in a different way) “lost” accounts for even fewer incidents (7%). Trauma jumps to the lead (40%); being stranded (22%) is second. Becoming lost is often confounded with hypothermia or may have been due to hypothermia.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Experience level among those who become lost varies widely. Inexperienced cavers tend to be male, marginally equipped, have no formal training and continue to move until light source fails. They are often agitated by fear and anxiety. Behavior is more unpredictable than that of experienced cavers, who are generally more and in better physical shape. If light is running out, experienced cavers will search for a dry, wind-free location. They typically try to leave markers (cairns, messages, indicators written in mud, and other attractants) for a rescue team. However, running out of light is rare (because of the use of LED lights) among experienced cavers. Rising water is another cause of becoming stranded in a cave. Rainfall in the immediate area is not required for cave waters to rise.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Like hunters, most cavers will go to great lengths to self-rescue since they are strongly motivated by avoiding embarrassment among friends. Many will follow air flows when looking for an entrance, although this does not always work. If this behavior is observed, it may be used to predict direction of travel. Younger subjects will respond to or yell at any sound. Older adults may not respond to weak sounds as their hearing may be diminished and they want to avoid the embarrassment of yelling at nothing. Young children, if hiding from parents, may not initially respond to searchers. Most incidents involve people who are unprepared and unskilled.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Day Climber</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Most day climbers must often travel at least some short distance prior to reaching technical or rock face. In all such cases if the primary purpose of the outing was to climb, then they were classified as a Climber. Generally, only a day trip is planned with the focus on the climb. It is possible that a day climber will return to base camp after a day of climbing. It can be noted that the trip to and from the climbing site is usually the cause of the incident. A majority are lost (49%) en route or returning from the climbing site. Day climbers have a higher fatality and injury rate than mountaineers, as well as poorer long-term survivability. Many have experienced a trauma (26%), almost always due to a fall. Some are stranded (12%), typically because of darkness or the realization that they cannot move up or down while climbing.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">A wide range of climbing experience exists. However, experience at climbing does not always correspond to outdoor skills (such as navigation). Most new climbers seek out or climb with experienced climbers; thus, wide mismatches in capabilities are possible. Generally, climbers tend to remain on/near designated routes. Weather/hazardous conditions are often important factors. Climbers are generally well-equipped and have a culture of being self-sufficient. They usually attempt to self-rescue.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Every year the American Alpine Club and the Alpine Club of Canada publish Accidents in North American Mountaineering. The book recounts detailed descriptions of climbing accidents. While it does not include subjects getting lost going to or coming from the actual climbing site, it does provide detailed statistics on the types of injuries seen. Given that the data source for climbers is for those involved in accidents, it is not unexpected that the trauma scenario is clearly in the lead. The most common problems are fractures (28%), lacerations (15%), bruises (10%), abrasions (8%), sprains (7%) and concussions (5%). Medical problems are not reported as often. The most common medical problems are hypothermia (3%), frostbite (3%), high altitude pulmonary edema (1.4%) and acute mountain sickness (0.8%).</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Mountaineer</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Mountaineers must often travel considerable distances before starting any technical work. Although a frequent problem noted among inexperienced mountaineers was attempted trips without proper equipment or experience. Overdue (39%) was the most common scenario and typically because the subject underestimated the difficulty of the terrain and the time actually required. The second most common scenario was becoming stranded (24%), usually because of weather but also due to lost equipment. Becoming lost (17%) was less common among mountaineers; and when it occurred it was almost always because of weather conditions. Trauma (15%) was also frequently seen, generally due to falls or falling debris. ISRID did not capture any avalanches in the database, mostly because these cases were classified as rescues or recoveries (only search statistics are reported in this chapter). Survivability can be quite good for most mountaineers since they are usually prepared for foul weather.</p>

    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Dementia</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info"> The Dementia category includes Alzheimer's disease and other related disorders (vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies among others). From a search and rescue perspective there is no appreciable difference between the different dementias. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of the irreversible dementias and the term is included since it is commonly used to represent all dementias. Regardless of activity, search subjects with dementia were placed into this category unless wheels or water involved. </p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info"> In dementia, the visual field (peripheral vision) is narrowed, creating "tunnel vision." A reduction in peripheral vision results in poor navigators using only what they see in front of them versus excellent navigators who also use scanning for landmarks they remember. This may account for dementia wanderers' trademark behavior of essentially moving straight ahead: They go until they get stuck. Direction of travel predicts a dementia subject's final location better than it does in most other subject categories. Every subject is different and determining the severity of the individual's dementia provides additional important insight. Mild to moderate severity is associated with more goal-directed wandering. Initially, the subject does in fact have a destination in mind. Distances traveled may be greater. The subject is more likely to use public transportation. Subjects with severe dementia tend to show random (i.e., no discernible goal) wandering, travel shorter distances and may have profound sensory disturbances. Exit-seeking behavior may be seen in both mild and severe dementia. One is more likely to see this behavior when a person is in a new location or has been taken out of a familiar environment.
        <h3>Hallmark behaviors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They go until they get "stuck." </li>
            <li>Appear to lack the ability to turn around and may ping-pong off some barriers. </li>
            <li>Direction of travel is a good predictor of where they will be found. Look for sign and attempt to determine exit door. </li>
            <li>Oriented to the past. The more severe the dementia, the further in the past they exist. Figure out where in the past the subject is currently "living" in order to determine possible destinations (e.g., a former residence, a work place). Investigative questions assist to better understand the subjects past (which, for them, may be the present). </li>
            <li>May attempt to travel to former residence, favorite place or what appears to be former residence, favorite place or workplace. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info"> In both urban and wilderness environments, the subject is highly likely to cross or depart from a road (66%). If the subject leaves the road or travel feature, he does not travel far. He may often go unnoticed unless his dress is highly unusual. Track offset statistics for dementia are the shortest of all subject categories. In the wilderness, the subject is typically walking or gets stuck in brush/briars or drainages. They are often found in structures. Subjects are also attracted to water features and will walk into water (perhaps without even realizing it is water). They are generally mobile for only a short period of time. In temperate domains, half of the subjects are mobile for less than an hour. In dry domains, subjects remain mobile longer. They will not leave many verifiable clues. They will not cry out for help or respond to shouts-only 1% are responsive. Some dementia subjects could be viewed as "passive-evasive." Since they do not perceive themselves as lost, they would not attempt to signal or even respond to shouts. There is a 25% fatality rate if the subject is not found within the first 24 hours. Fatality rate is higher in hot climates and cold rainy climates.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Despondent</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">This category includes people who have been depressed, for whom the possibility of suicide is strong or who have expressed intent to commit suicide. Not all despondents attempt suicide. At the time of the incident it may be difficult to determine whether the person is despondent or suicidal, hence both categories have been combined. However, the information below will provide additional information and insight into the probability of a suicide attempt.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Long-term risk factors include a family history of suicide, attempted suicide, depression, or alcohol or other substance abuse. There is an increased chance of fatality if the subject is male. Males have a greater probability of using more violent means for method of suicide than females. Several personality traits also increase the risk: black-and-white/all-or-nothing thinking, difficulty to change thinking, excessive perfectionism, high standards, pessimistic view of the future, impulsive nature, low self-esteem, and/or poor problem solving skills.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Short-term risk factors include being divorced, separated, widowed, older (above 65 years), younger (below 25 years), retired, unemployed, and/or having few social supports. The psychiatric disorders most associated with suicide are depression, substance misuse, and schizophrenia. Other less strongly associated disorders are personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and panic attacks.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Subjects with terminal illnesses have an increased risk of suicide. Huntington’s disease, cancer, and dementia are all well-known examples. In some cases, homicide-suicide may occur.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Several factors make it less likely the person will attempt suicide. These “protective factors” include a hopeful outlook on life, currently receiving mental health care, taking care of children under 18, and strong social supports. Immediate factors that may precipitate a suicide attempt are imprisonment or threat of imprisonment, humiliating social events, recent job loss, recent residence move, recent loss or separation, anniversaries of past deaths or other significant losses, work or school problems, and/or unwanted pregnancy. High likelihood predictors of suicide include availability of lethal means, determined method, saying goodbye, giving away possessions, and leaving a note. Despondents are most likely to be found on a trail, path or at their destination. In many cases, they simply walk out. Suicidal behavior resulting in a search is more complex.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Two distinct patterns emerge for distance traveled from IPP: 1. Most subjects are “seeking to get just out of sight” (50% found within 0.7 to 1.2 miles of IPP). This is particularly true in an urban environment (25% found within 100 yards of IPP). The subject’s location is often at the transition line between a true urban and a rural (wooded) interface. 2. Subjects seek out a specific location that is often scenic or significant in their life history. Location may represent a method of suicide (cliff, bridge, water). Those seeking scenic or significant locations are willing to travel. Viewpoints are a common destination. However, once they reach the location they will still want to be “just out of sight.” No despondent subjects are truly “lost.” </p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Many survivors walk out of the environment on their own. Otherwise, they are typically located in structures. Subjects may hang themselves; searchers need to look up. Method of suicide is dependent upon age and country/culture. Subjects are often found at the interface of two different types of terrain. It is rare to find them in thick brush or briars. They rarely respond to searchers.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">If a direction of travel is obtained, it has an excellent chance of providing insight into the subject’s location. Because the number of despondents with dispersion data is quite limited (n=6), the results must be viewed with great reservation. Nevertheless, it is telling that all six were found within 30 degrees of the initial direction of travel. Despondent is tentatively the subject classification with the narrowest dispersion angle.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Consider searcher safety in light of “suicide by proxy” attempts (aka “suicide by cop”). Risk factors include being male (98%), age 16-35 (68%), a history of domestic violence (39%), a previous suicide attempt (46%), on own one’s property, and possession of a firearm (48%).</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Gatherer</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Gatherer includes several different types of subjects who go out into the woods to gather various objects: mushroom pickers, berry pickers, Christmas tree hunters, wood collectors (but not loggers), ginseng hunters, pinon nut gatherers, pine cone collectors, rock collectors and plant/seed collectors. Photographers are placed in the Worker category. Mushroom pickers make up 70% of the cases in the Gatherer category. How- ever, no significant difference was seen between mushroom pickers and the other types of gatherers in distance traveled, scenario, find location, or survivability. Mushroom pickers may not fare as well under long-term survival conditions.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Some of the items (e.g., certain mushrooms, ginseng) gatherers seek may have significant commercial value. Therefore, gatherers are often highly secretive about the locations they visit. In some cases, the “special spot” or the activity itself may also involve trespassing or violating other laws. Many gatherers are also immigrants who gathered food in the home country. They may be suspicious of any official. For all of the above reasons, investigation is often difficult. Gatherers will typically travel to a specific area where the target object is located. They may be willing to travel some distance to start collecting, but they are generally not as ambitious as hikers. They may have a favorite area. Amount of time allocated to the activity will provide some insight into the distance the person is willing to travel to reach the collection area. Size of collection container also gives some insight into overall time the subject was planning to spend gathering. Gatherers often depart trails because they are focused on the object and fail to get a good overall view of area. Most gathering activities require moving off road and trails. Gatherers jump from spot to spot without paying attention to general area. Without landmarks it is difficult to navigate back when viewing from opposite direction. Most become lost (81%) because of poor or no navigation/outdoor skills. Once lost, their behavior becomes similar to Hiker.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Mushroom pickers tend to have limited equipment (e.g., knife, basket) and may have little navigation/outdoor experience. Many participants are indigenous people or immigrants. Be aware that safe mushrooms in Europe can be deadly in North America. Mushroom pickers often focus on the ground while gathering. Mushrooms can be highly specific to certain times of the year, trees, slopes, moisture, etc. Most pickers are seeking a certain type of mushroom. The more experienced the picker, the more important it is to understand the habitats or likely locations of the mushrooms. Consult with experts or mycologists about likely habitats.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Mushroom pickers will typically travel to a specific general area where mushrooms are located. They may be willing to travel some distance to start collecting, but they are generally not as ambitious as hikers or other gatherers. Overdue only accounts for 9% of cases. In some cases, subjects were stranded because of snow or mud. Most subjects continue walking until they locate a road or trail and then follow it. Majority of subjects go out alone (83%). It is important to determine experience level of the subject and then determine a favorite or good location for the target object. The more experienced the gatherer, the more important it is to understand the target object’s habitat or likely locations. Subject typically leaves in good weather and only brings equipment and clothing appropriate for the conditions at the time.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Most subjects eventually wander out to a road or trail, or they may even return home. Subjects in the wilderness tend to be found along canyons, creeks or drainages. Medical and trauma scenarios are possible. Subjects have poor long-term survivability because of limited clothing and equipment.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Hiker</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The Hiker category includes walkers, hill walkers/fell walkers (in the United Kingdom), day hikers, multi-day hikers (backpackers), trekkers and trampers (“serious hikers” in New Zealand). Mountaineers have been placed into the Climber category. Children (12 and under) missing while hiking were placed into the appropriate age group. Subjects with a cognitive disability (e.g., intellectual disability, autistic) were placed into the appropriate category, even if lost while hiking.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Hikers are oriented to trails. The lost scenario accounts for 68% of missing hikers. Errors typically occur at decision points (trail junctions, obscure trails, game trails, social trails, head of drainages). Other common errors include heading the wrong direction down a trail. At night or under limited light conditions, the color of trail blazes can be confusing. In addition, certain colors of trail blazes may be confused by those with color blindness. Errors at decision points account for 56% of lost cases. Errors can be (standing at a trail junction and making the wrong decision after reading the map upside down) or passive (not even noticing they left the trail). Hikers are guided by terrain to other linear features once they are lost. Many follow path of least resistance. Poor navigators fail to notice landmarks; while good navigators make a point of noticing landmarks (both local and distant). Youths and some young adults will also cut switchbacks. This often results in missing the trail. It may result in the subject moving uphill, even up and over a ridge line. Among hikers, 32-48% will be found uphill in relation to the IPP. A recent phenomenon is lost subjects moving uphill or leaving trails to move uphill in order to obtain cell phone coverage. Many attempt to reorient themselves by trail running or finding a high spot. Hikers in dry domains stay mobile twice as long as in temperate domains and typically travel farther, have greater elevation changes and a wider dispersion angle. They are also more likely to travel cross-country. In general, around a third (30-40%) will travel at night.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Being overdue accounts for 16% of search incidents. Hikers are often delayed because of poor estimates of fitness/travel time, lack of light, and blisters, especially if carrying heavy packs or hiking for the first time (or first time in a long time). Many hikers discard equipment when lost or in trouble. Many lack skills for remote areas.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Horseback Rider</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The Horseback Rider category includes those who are riding horses for recreational purposes and work-related tasks. If the person was involved in another activity such as hunting, and became missing while riding a horse, they would be classified as a Horseback Rider. It was possible to determine from the data the actual activity from the search incident report. During actual search incidents a search planner may need to consider multiple subject categories for planning purposes (such as Hunter, Angler, Worker). However, if the horse returns without the rider, this might strongly suggest the Horseback Rider scenario.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">In slightly more than half of the cases (55%), the subject simply was lost because of classic reasons (e.g., errors at decision points, no map, not familiar with area). While data is still somewhat limited, much greater distances are seen in the distance from the IPP for dry domain incidents compared to Temperate domain incidents. In almost a quarter of the cases (22%), the subject fell off the horse and suffered trauma. In almost all of the remaining quarter of the cases, the rider was simply overdue. Therefore, determining and following the intended route is important for both the trauma and overdue scenario. The horse will allow for carrying some basic supplies, however poor survivability is seen in long-term cases (greater than 48 hours).</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Hunter</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Hunter includes all types of hunters (game and birds). Important differences between hunter types are expected but at this point remain statistically unexplored. Children (12 and under) are placed in the appropriate age group.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">It is important to determine type of hunter and typical practices used by hunters (tree stands, blinds, tracking, etc.). Becoming lost accounts for 70% of search incidents. Many hunters will avoid using the word “lost” when confronted with searchers. Hunters’ focus/pursuit of game is the primary cause of becoming lost, with nightfall second. Following game or wounded game often leads them to deadfall areas, boulder fields, underbrush or dense forest. Most hunters have high motivation to locate game. They go to great lengths to self-rescue. Some will avoid rescuers out of embarrassment or fear of having to pay rescue fees. Many rely on GPS, radios and cell phones and may lack outdoor skills. They are usually mobile and responsive. They tend to travel at night (40-80%) and will follow linear features. Unlike hikers, they may take advantage of easier travel on ridges or are more likely to travel cross-country. However, they use travel aids when available. Older or more experienced hunters are more comfortable with building a fire and shelter while waiting for daylight. A third (33%) will self-rescue or find their own way out after becoming lost.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Many hunters travel light with few provisions. They respond well to attraction and often give three whistle blasts or fire three shots (SAR response should be two whistle blasts). Survivability may be an issue in long-term cases. Weather, equipment and training are important factors. Game is often most just prior to major weather fronts moving in.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Intellectual Disability</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The Intellectual Disability (ID) category includes any subject of any age who has been identified as having Intellectual Disability. The term Intellectual Disability is synonymous with the archaic term of “mental retardation.” Intellectual disability may be more acceptable for general conversation. Intellectual disability does not include learning disabilities or dyslexia (unless the IQ is also low). While most ID search subjects are children, the category also contains adults. For subjects who have a combination of psychosis, dementia and intellectual disability, the primary or original disorder determines the subject category. While subjects with ID might have been involved in an outdoor activity, they would still be placed in the Intellectual Disability category unless using wheels.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Intellectual Disability is characterized by the combination of (1) below average intellectual functioning (IQ below 70); (2) impairments in daily life (communication, self-care, social skills, work, safety, health, etc.); and (3) an onset prior to age 18. Most subjects (85%) have mild intellectual disability (IQ 50-55 to 70). An IQ of 60 is “equivalent” to functioning at a third-grade level. People with ID develop social and communication skills during preschool years, have normal motor skills, and may not be much different than other young children. As adults they may achieve minimal self-support, but need support especially when under stress. The term “mental age” is often used and may be misleading. For example, the term “mental age of a six-year-old” means the person would get the same number of correct answers on an IQ test as the average six-year-old. Since a mentally disabled adult has had an entire lifetime to learn, six-year-old statistics and the lost person behavior profile of a child that age may not be the most appropriate.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Thus, the behavioral patterns are a blend of Child and Dementia. Intellectually disabled children best match the equivalent child age, with the exception of having an older, stronger body. Intellectually disabled adults best match dementia behavior. Unlike children, few Intellectual Disability subjects get lost taking a shortcut. Almost all are unresponsive (93%). The subject will not travel to an identifiable target. Many are found in structures (including yards and vehicles) or along a road. They will travel into brush or structures to seek shelter. They are attracted to water features. Much like children, some may be attracted to animals or other favorite objects. They have good survivability because of the urgent response, but long-term survival is not good.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">If lost with a group of children, the intellectually disabled individual will often be a “follower” rather than the leader. Therefore, the group’s expected statistics should be derived from the oldest child with a typical IQ.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Mental Illness</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">This category contains those with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, or those with a mood disorder (e.g., bipolar). In a clinical setting, psychotic disorders and mood disorders should not be lumped together. Search records usually only indicate mental illness, psychotic, or schizophrenia, but search planners should be familiar with the entire list of psychotic disorders. Subjects with substance induced psychotic disorder were placed into the Substance Abuse category, although search planners should utilize both profiles and statistics. While many subjects with dementia may experience psychotic symptoms, they were all placed into the Dementia category. Likewise, subjects with intellectual disability may also experience psychotic symptoms, but were placed into the Intellectual Disability category.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Psychosis has several different definitions, including delusions, prominent hallucinations, disorganized speech, and catatonic behavior.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Schizophrenia is characterized by two (or more) characteristics:• delusion,• hallucinations,• disorganized speech,• disorganized or catatonic behavior,• lack of normal emotions or goals.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The time period that the symptoms exist help define the specific disorder. Delusions can take many forms with persecutory (paranoia) being the most common. Search subjects have run out into the woods based upon the belief someone is out to harm them. Other forms of delusion include referential (special messages are being sent to the specific person by mass media or people on the street), somatic (involving the body, e.g., hundreds of spiders crawling on them), religious, or grandiose. Delusions may be classified as bizarre, which means they are beyond the range of human possibility (their brain has been switched with another person) or non-bizarre (maybe the police or homeland security have bugged your room and are watching you). Hallucinations can take on many forms, but auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) are the most common.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Bipolar disorders are actually classified with mood disorders, which include mood episodes, depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and other mood disorders. Bipolar disorder is sometimes called manic depression. Depressive disorder is described in the Despondent category. Only bipolar disorders have been placed in the Mental Illness category. However, because of the formal link between bipolar and mood, information from the Despondent category must be considered, including the strong possibility of suicide. Bipolar disorder involves different ends of the spectrum of mood, from depression to mania. Psychotic symptoms may also be present. During the depressive pole the likelihood of suicide or other despondent behaviors must be examined.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Lack of medication or stopping medications caused most incidents. It is important to determine when medication was last taken and its half-life. No subjects in this category were “lost” in the traditional sense. The majority of subjects are evasive, often running away/hiding from something, which may include searchers. Fear of authority or paranoia is common among search subjects. Some subjects will hide in a residence. Subjects did not travel to identifiable destinations. Subjects were often found in structures or along roads. Active hiding is not uncommon and subjects will evade searchers. Fear of police or any uniform may become an issue. Cases exist of subjects attacking searchers, so searcher safety will need to be assessed. They tend not to penetrate into thick brush/briars. Many travel considerable distances without ever being “far” from the IPP. Research from police incidents from the UK indicate those with bipolar disorders (median 1.8 km/ 1.1 mile) don’t travel as far as those with psychotic disorders (median 2.9 km/ 1.9 mile). This is consistent with the depressive pole and despondent behavior, which has a SAR median of only 0.5 km/ 0.3 miles for urban cases. What remains unknown is distances traveled when in the mania or hypomania phase. These distances could potentially be greater.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Survivability for mental illness is surprisingly high. Even at 96 hours (four days) out the survivability rate is 80% (although the number of cases is somewhat limited at four days out).</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Motorcycle</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Motorcycles include any motorized two-wheel vehicle. Many were described as dirt bikes. Mountain bikers and motorcycles are two separate categories. Half of motorcycle search incidents involve being lost; causes are similar to ATV riders and mountain bikers: a missed decision point, obscure trails, leaving trails, nightfall, and no (or poor) map all lead to mistakes. Overdue accounts for 22% of incidents. Trauma (21%) and medical (4%) also are major factors. Overdue, trauma, and medical scenarios are typically found on the intended route, if known. Mechanical breakdowns and running out of gas also occur. Distances from the IPP can be considerable, but the difference between mountain bikes and motorcycles is not that great (the biggest difference is in the 25%).</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Mountain Bike</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">This category includes subjects involved in the recreational use of mountain bikes. Mountain bikes do not include motorized bikes, which are described under Motorcycles (see Other).</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Many mountain bikers will drive to a specific location in a vehicle first. Therefore, the vehicle may need to be located prior to starting a meaningful search. Half of missing mountain bikers are lost (52%), most commonly because of taking a wrong trail at a decision point. A bicycle left behind indicates the subject might be going cross-country (unless bike is found damaged). Many are simply overdue (25%) because of fitness level, darkness, flat tires or poor trail conditions. Mountain bikers may be aggressive and often underestimate route in terms of difficulty and time to complete. Trauma cases (16%) were found near a trail, but also in a ditch or over a cliff. Searchers must pay extra attention for tracks at locations where the bike may easily leave the trail. Most mountain bikers carry few provisions, equipment and minimal clothing. Most carry cell phones and may seek out higher ground to get a signal.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Non-Powered Boat</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Almost all (89%) missing non-powered watercraft were found in/under water. The remaining missing boats (11%) were eventually located on their trailers or vehicles, or parked at a structure. Unlike in most missing person categories, being lost only accounts for a small percentage (18%). Instead, stranded (13%), overdue (29%), and trauma (31%) account for most incidents. Scenario information is from ISRID results. Being overdue is often related to misjudging current flow and how long a trip will require. If paddling, many subjects overestimate their ability and endurance, which thus causes delay in returning. The high percentage of trauma cases relates to being in a swiftwater setting. An ominous outcome can often be projected for those in inner-tubes who attempt serious swiftwater, especially whitewater. Drowning (4%) is not as prevalent, but it still occurs. Typical behaviors relate closely to the type of watercraft, subject’s experience, and specific type of activity. Swimming ability, water temperature, and wearing (or not wearing) a PFD are also major factors. Long-term survivability (>48 hours) is not good, but possible.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Skier-Nordic</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Nordic or cross-country skiers include both recreational and those using skis as a method of transportation. It does not include alpine skiers or those with snowshoes, each of whom are placed in their own separate categories.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Skiers are well-dressed for immediate weather and often carry some equipment including some food and water. However, there are no long waits in lift lines, so Nordic skiers are dressed for rigorous exercise. They may have some survival equipment and 60% have some survival training. Most are in good physical shape and have some experience. Being lost accounts for almost all of the incidents (90%). Almost half (46%) will self-rescue. When they are lost, it is because of taking wrong turns and missing trails. Weather, white-out or blizzard conditions, and darkness are major contributors to mistakes at decision points. Many skiers are found at a trailhead or on a trail, but they may also be found back at the lodge, a bar, or home; thus, an investigative scenario is important. Being overdue (5%) is typically caused by misjudging time, snow conditions, weather conditions, equipment problems, and miscommunication. When lost or overdue, skiers either keep moving to stay warm, build snow shelters or break into structures. Mitchell found that 30-45% moved at night. When natural light (moon) or other light is available, the subject is much more likely to move at night.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Avalanches may be an important factor (2%). Skiers (no differentiation between Alpine and Nordic for this statistic) account for 24% of avalanche fatalities in the US. Backcountry skiers accounted for 16%, out-of bounds skiers 8%, and skiing in-bounds (1%). Trauma does not appear to be a major issue for Nordic skiers. If the subject was skiing across frozen lakes or ponds, consider a broken ice scenario.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Person in Current Water</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">For persons last seen in moving water (rivers and streams), the distance from the IPP is dependent upon both the current and the wind. In most cases, the current will be the dominant factor. The flow of moving water can be quite complex. The fastest current is found in the center of the channel (mid-stream) and near the surface. At the bottom and the edges of a river (along banks), water flow is much slower and eddies may form.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">It is possible for a person to be found slightly upstream of the IPP. Where a stream or river bends, the fastest current is found on the outside bend and debris often accumulates on the inside bend. Swimmers in a stream will try to swim to the banks or to a midstream object. A drowning subject will quickly sink to the bottom. See the table “Distance a Body Travels while Sinking in Lost Person Behavior Book” to determine how far away the body should be from the IPP based upon the current. Once the body reaches the bottom it tends to stay in place because of eddies and bottom friction. The river creates several other high probability areas, including the upstream side of boulders, strainers, likely foot entrapment spots, low-head dams, and other similar hazards. Any place that debris is found also has the potential of stopping a body. When a body goes over a waterfall, a likely area exists in the bowl cut underneath the waterfall. Deep pools can collect debris and be calm in spite of whitewater. Riverbanks should also be considered likely areas. The distances provided in the “distance from IPP” table come from water search dog data and represent the worst case scenario. Only the average (1.1 miles) and maximum (8 miles) case figures are available. Remove the maximum case and the average drops all the way down to 0.8 miles.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Person in Flat Water</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">When poor swimmers or subjects in cold water get in trouble, they typically head for the nearest shore, a tree sticking out, a prominent cliff jutting up or, at night, the nearest light or sound. These points may not be the easiest way out of the water. If the subject is a non-swimmer or incapacitated, then the distance from the IPP is quite small and measured in yards or meters. Data was obtained from two different sources: an air-scent water dog study by Hardy and from informal studies conducted by Hendrick. Most of the variability in flat or no current water is in determining the exact IPP, finding the IPP out on the water, precisely measuring where the body was actually recovered, the presence of small currents, and the effect of wind. A general rule of thumb if there is no current and wind: 50% of bodies are found within 10 feet (3 meters) of IPP. The 95-99% is determined by the depth of the water equals the radius of the likely search area. Actual data from air-scent water dog searches (Note: Divers are usually tried first, and would be successful within the radius. If not, then dogs are typically requested to help locate other areas.) Hardy reported an average distance from the IPP of 50 yards and a maximum distance of 500 yards. These cases most likely represent a poorly reported IPP. If the reported IPP was in fact correct, subjects move away from the IPP due to two forces: winds or small currents.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Winds may be the predominant force in flat water (lakes and ponds). Winds (leeway) will only affect the person while he is still on top of the water. The effect is generally small due to drag and often, the short amount of time the person stays on the surface of the water. Tables are presented in the statistics section, which allow the user to calculate the leeway for various objects in the water at different wind speeds. Once the body resurfaces, it may be blown a considerable distance.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Person in Flood Water</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Flood waters are similar to rivers and streams. The critical difference is that a body will not stop moving once it reaches the bottom. The body can roll along the bottom and be pushed by debris. This means boulders and strainers become even more important. The distances traveled can become quite significant. Survivors are typically found stranded, often in trees. Bodies may also be found up in trees after flood water subsides. Bodies will typically be caught in debris and may be partially or completely buried by mud or sand. High probability areas are located wherever a change in the direction of travel occurs for an object being carried by a torrential current. Changes of direction occur at the junction of fast flowing streams and rivers (a sand barge is formed across the channel from a stream’s entry point); places where a confined river suddenly slows down due to a large area to spread out; and classic features such as hydraulics formed by low-head dams, waterfalls, or rocks and strainers. Although based upon only nine incidents, the full distance from IPP data is available for flood water. The 95% is 38 miles (62 km); the maximum case recorded was 40 miles.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Power Boat</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Almost all (81%) missing powered boats were found in/under water and another 8% on the rocks. The remaining missing boats (12%) were eventually located on their trailers safely parked. Unlike in most missing person categories, being lost only accounts for a small percentage (10%). Instead, stranded (33%), overdue (26%), and drowning (17%) are the causes of most incidents. Scenario information is from ISRID results. Darkness, weather, on-board emergencies, and misunderstandings account for many of the incidents. Alcohol often plays a key role. Some subjects are able to be guided back to shore with a strong light from shore. Subjects have poor long-term survival.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Road Vehicle</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Unlike most other categories, when a vehicle is missing, being lost (1%) is not the most common scenario. Instead, the vehicle is typically stranded (23%), overdue (16%), or there is a medical/trauma problem (28%). Investigation is important since criminal, evading, and investigative scenarios account for 43% of the incidents. Subjects are found along a road (40%), back at a structure (24%), or caught in a water feature (12%). Vehicles may also be found a short distance off the road if involved in an accident. Searchers must look for tire marks or signs of a car leaving the road. Air resources are a powerful tool when searching for a vehicle. Long-term survival is possible with survival knowledge or sometimes just common sense and determination.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Runner</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Runners include joggers, runners, fell runners, speedwalkers (racewalkers), and adventure runners involved in running-only events. If the event involved swimming, mountain bikes, navigation (orienteering, rogaining or related sports), or any other type of activity (so called “Ironman” events) it would be classified as Extreme Sports (see Other). Both event and solo running are included in the Runner category.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Many runners run in early morning or evening, so darkness can become a major factor (69%). A common scenario is a runner who is on an unfamiliar route and misses a turn or misjudges time. This often occurs while on vacation, thus the runner may not be familiar with the area at all. While runners tend to be fit, they carry minimal clothing and usually no equipment. A few runners carry cell phones. Maps and light sources are also typically not carried. It is typical for a runner to commit a new route to memory and head off. Most runners stick to trails and roads and would make the same mistakes as hikers. Adventure and longer distance runners may carry minimal equipment. In the case of event running, some survival equipment may be required by the race organizers. Some runners will go cross-country. Investigation will usually determine special running shoes and prior practice if the runner tends to go cross-country. Trauma, medical, and investigative scenarios are possible. Long-term survival is poor for runners because of minimal clothing and lack of supplies. Sudden and dramatic changes in the weather require an urgent search.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">In some of the more dramatic and rare searches, runners have been attacked by wild animals. In these cases, the subject was dragged off the trail a short distance, which often initially appears to be a homicide. The animal is often nearby.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Snowboarder</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">This category is made up of those involved in snowboarding, including lift, backcountry, in-bounds, and out-of-bounds snowboarders. It does not include skiers.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Snowboarders are well-dressed for immediate weather and often carry some equipment including some food and water. Many started as skiers and mi- grated to snowboarding. They tend to be in good physical shape and have some experience. Being lost accounts for almost all of the incidents (77%). Over a quarter (26%) will self-rescue. Snowboarders become search subjects because of separation and then getting lost, boarding down the wrong chutes that do not allow an exit, wrong turns, darkness, boarding out-of-bounds, and avalanches.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">When snowboarders are lost it is because of wrong turns and missing trails. Weather, white-out or blizzard conditions and darkness are major contributors to mistakes at decision points. Snowboarders who travel out-of-bounds often find travel limited by cliffs or bluffs. Friends of those who travel out-of-bounds may not typically tell authorities, but will often know if the practice is common. Many may leave equipment behind when in trouble and may attempt to climb back up to the point they went out of bounds. They will and can hike on foot if they reach a trail or road. Most snowboarders travel downhill but some will travel uphill for view enhancement or to obtain a cell phone signal. Also, they are willing to travel at night if a natural (moon) or artificial light source exists. Many are found at a trailhead or on a trail, but they may also be found back at the lodge, a bar or home.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">In many cases, it becomes an investigative effort because of the snowboarder failing to communicate to the rest of his/her party or finding alternative transport back to lodging. Thus, the investigative scenario remains important. Being overdue (7%) is typically caused by misjudging time, snow conditions, weather conditions, equipment problems and miscommunication. Severe weather can also strand some snowboarders. When lost or overdue, snowboarders either keep moving to stay warm, build snow shelters, or break into structures. Avalanches may be an important factor (3%). Snowboarders account for 11% of avalanche fatalities in the US. Trauma (7%) may be an issue for snowboarders.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Snowmobiler</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The category Snowmobiler includes those involved in driving or riding on a snowmobile for any reason, although most reported incidents involved recreational use. Sled is also used for snowmobile. It does not refer to toboggans, tubes, wooden sleds, sleighs or other types of objects used to slide down a hill.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">There is a wide range of experience among snowmobilers. Subjects are well-dressed for immediate weather and often carry some equipment including some food and water. The machine itself is an excellent source of survival equipment, if the person is trained or aware. Good long-term survivability. Most follow trails, but in some areas they will travel cross-country. The most common scenario is becoming lost (39%), often because of taking the wrong trails. Decision points, wrong turns and missing trails remain important factors. Weather, white-out or blizzard conditions and darkness are major contributors to mistakes at decision points. Only 11% will self-rescue. Many snowmobilers are found at a trailhead or on a trail, but they may also be found back at the lodge, a bar or at home.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Investigative scenario remains important. Running out of gas, mechanical breakdown, or becoming stuck results in being stranded (25%). Subjects then tend to stay put for the night or walk out (and then may become lost). When lost or overdue, subjects either keep moving to stay warm, build snow shelters, or break into structures. Avalanches may be an important factor (2%). Snowmobilers account for 41% of avalanche fatalities in the US. Accidents resulting in trauma (16%) are the third most common cause of incidents. Being overdue is caused by trail conditions, poor estimates of time, or related causes and accounts for 15% of searches. If subjects were snowmobiling across frozen lakes or ponds, consider a broken ice scenario.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Snowshoer</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The category Snowshoer includes anyone who was using snowshoes as the method of locomotion. In all recorded incidents, it was for recreational use. Several of the cases involved simply putting on a new pair of snowshoes and heading out the door during a heavy snow and then becoming lost. The majority of cases involved a planned trip.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Snowshoers are well-dressed for immediate weather and, if on a planned trip, often carry some equipment including some food and water. They may have some survival equipment. Many are in good physical shape and have some experience. However, with more modern snowshoes that are easy to use, many were inexperienced and underestimated the physical exertion required, resulting in exhaustion or misjudging the length of a trip. Being lost accounts for most of the incidents (71%). Almost a quarter (23%) will self-rescue. It is important to monitor the trailhead, other trailheads, vehicle, or home. When they are lost it is usually because of taking wrong turns and missing trails. Weather, white-out or blizzard conditions, and darkness are major contributors to mistakes at decision points. Upon reaching a trail, some subjects walked over the trail without realizing it because of inattention or conditions. Many snowshoers are found at a trailhead or on a trail. If out of shape or a new user, consider possibility of exhaustion.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Investigative scenario remains important. Being overdue (6%) is typically caused by misjudging time, snow conditions, weather conditions, equipment problems, physical fitness, and miscommunication. When lost or overdue, subjects either keep moving to stay warm, build snow shelters, or break into structures. Avalanches may be an important factor. Snowshoers account for 5% of avalanche fatalities in the US. Trauma (6%) does not appear to be a major issue for snowshoers. If the subject was snowshoeing across frozen lakes or ponds, consider a broken ice scenario.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Substance Intoxication</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">This category includes those under the influence of a substance, typically alcohol or an illicit substance. While the term “substance abuse” is used, a more clinically correct term would be “substance intoxication.” In many cases, the subject does in fact also abuse a substance(s), but it is not required to be placed into this category. The category would not typically be used if the subject was involved in another activity (a boater or angler under the influence would still be categorized as Boating/Watercraft or Angler). If the subject was in a vehicle, crashed, and then left the vehicle, he would be placed in the Abandoned Vehicle category.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The most common scenario was a subject at a party or pub/bar who became drunk, left en route to a destination, typically on foot, and then failed to arrive. Investigative finds (29% urban) often involve the subject going to another friend’s house without notifying the reporting party. Subjects are typically poorly dressed or poorly equipped for the weather. They have poor long-term survival. Many intoxicated individuals are drawn to water. They may attempt to swim or enter into the water. Many individuals were in an argument or fight prior to being last seen. Subjects also tend to lie down in the outdoors to “sleep off” effects, often in severe weather. The high fatality rate (42% urban) suggests an urgent need to search after the basic investigation.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">4WD Vehicle</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Four-wheel drive (4wd) incidents usually involved recreational use. Becoming lost was the most common scenario (34%), with stranded or stuck (28%), overdue (22%), and trauma (12%) being important. The majority of 4wd vehicles are found on a road (64%), but off-road “jeep” trails or open scrub country are also possible locations. Destinations, routes, and general area for recreation become more important in determining the search area. Air resources are useful. Subjects exhibit the full range of behavior, from technically savvy with GPS tracking to simple, unplanned “out for some fun.” Some drivers follow roads and trails while others go cross-country. Local area and vegetation may limit cross-country travel. If stranded, water crossings are common.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">After an accident, running out of gas, or becoming stranded (snow, wedged on a rock, etc.), some occupants of the vehicle may decide to abandon the vehicle. The goal of leaving the vehicle may be either to get rescue or to evade law enforcement because of a possible driving (or other) violation. If they are evading, they typically return to a residence and claim not to have been driving. Criminal and evading scenarios account for almost a quarter (21%) of the incidents. Investigative finds account for another quarter (26%). Simply becoming lost while on foot accounts for almost half the incidents (42%). A subject suffering from a medical or trauma-related problem accounts for only 10% of the incidents. Subjects leaving a vehicle may or may not be prepared for weather conditions depending upon what is typically kept in the vehicle. Fuel status or how the engine heater can be used may be a determining factor. Subject most likely will not have a detailed map of the area. Most subjects attempt to follow roads, but some will also follow linear features or end up in water features.</p>
    </a><a href="#" class="list-group-item"><H1 class="text-default">Worker</H1>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">The Worker category is comprised of those who were working in the outdoors. The category consists mostly of forestry workers (42%), ranchers/farmers (17%), and government workers (15%). It also contains prospectors, contractors, wilderness firefighters, researchers, photographers, surveyors, naturalists, geologists, and even missing SAR personnel (three cases). It does not contain gatherers.</p>
    <p class="list-group-item-text text-info">Most subjects carry special equipment and may carry survival equipment. Many carried a GPS unit, but were not fully trained in its use. Most subjects work in the outdoors on a regular basis. Subjects often leave trails and roads in order to conduct work. Track offset distances can be quite large. Being lost was still the most common scenario (52%), followed by overdue (28%). Errors at decision points caused the most lost scenario cases. It was common for the subject to be comfortable spending the night outdoors. Cases frequently cite being “disoriented.” Workers were often new to the area or using new equipment more prone to problems.</p></a>
