#SARCAT
Search and Rescue Collection & Analysis Tool (SARCAT) is a web-hosted application that simplifies the collection and analysis of your team’s or agencies SAR data. Its goal is simple; make the collection of data easy, accurate, and standardized. This is accomplished with smartforms, auto-calculations, and an intuitive user inter-
face. The user then reaps the benefits with built in data analysis, reporting, mapping, and the ability to contribute to ISRID. In this way, all SAR providers help each other.
##Key Features
* _World-wide map interface with topographic, street, and aerial imagery. Simply drag icons onto the map to mark key locations (Initial Planning Point, Incident Location, Find Location, decision points, revised PLS/LKP, intended and actual route). _

* _Smartforms adapts to information being entered, reducing the amount of data entry._
* _“Auto-calculation” based upon previous data; weather, ecoregion, elevation, dispersion, and spatial data automatically entered and calculated._

* _Browser interface can be opened from any desktop, laptop, or tablet._

* _Administrative functions provide user control, customization of data fields, and preferences._

* _Security features include user authentication with password encryption, NOSQL database logs all data entry, versioned database in case of accidental deletion, event log,optional personally identifiable information, if enabled, is encrypted_

* _Visualize your data with built in dashboards, analysis tools, maps, and reports._
