<h2 id="faq-troubleshooting"><strong>FAQ &amp; Troubleshooting</strong></h2>

<p><strong><em>How is SARCAT installed?</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SARCAT is designed to be run on a server for an entire organization. Node &amp; Mongodb are the backbones behind the scenes. If you know your way around these tools, you will be able to get the most out of SARCAT and the data. If you already have node &amp; mongo running on your server, getting up and running with sarcat will be pretty easy for you. If not, dont worry - we compiled all the necessary dependencies into a zip file for your platform.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Where is my data stored?</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When SARCAT is installed, by default it will create the database in your home directory. If you wish to change this location, simply open up config/config.json and change the value of <strong>sarcatStorage</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Can I change my default ports?</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes! inside of config/config.json you have the ability to change your default ports of <strong>sarcatPort</strong> &amp; <strong>databasePort</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>How do I update SARCAT?</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using git, you can just update the latest with a pull. if you downloaded the zip file, extract it into your home SARCAT directory. It will automatically connect to you latest database if you used the default sarcatdb in your home directory. If you changed this, update the config to reflect your desired settings.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>How do a wipeout my database and start over?</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>As long as this is exactly what you want, you can delete your local copy of the <strong>/sarcatData</strong> from your home directory. The next time you restart SARCAT it will be created again. Or you can simply change the database by updating the config.json.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>I am _still_ having trouble installing!</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>SARCAT is intended to be used as a web server. If installing on a local network, you may need to contact your administrator to be granted access rights to install. While the steps and dependencies are minimal for this software, proper knowledge of your network is important to ensure quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure proper priveleges are set on your machine and install paths</p></li>
<li>Check firewall settings.</li>
<li>You may have mongo already running on your machine and unable to create a new port for it. Check out <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/145882/how-to-kill-a-process-from-the-cli-in-windows/">this reference</a> to kill a running process </li>
<li>If you have npm installed, you can try removing your <strong>/node_modules</strong> directory and <code>npm install</code> to install again.</li>
<li>Feel free to contact us with any question or concerns you may have. This is an open source project and we encourage collaboration in order to create the best product possible!</li>
